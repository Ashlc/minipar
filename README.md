# MiniPar Language Interpreter ğŸ‘“

The interpreter will be written Python and will be able to interpret and execute a rendition of the MiniPar language as requested by Professor Arturo.

## :sparkles: Differential features 

:rock: - **Static typing**: Our rendition is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable must be declared before it is used.

:straight_ruler: - **No indentation**: Our rendition does not use indentation to define blocks of code. Instead, it uses curly braces.
